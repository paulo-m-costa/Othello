Hans Solo, though some friends suggested I look at "A genetic algorithm to improve an Othello program"
by Jean-Marc Alliot and Nicolas Durand found at 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.1218&rep=rep1&type=pdf ,
which helped enormously.

Including the heuristic array at the top of page 2 of the above paper was easily the largest
improvement I made to the AI. The wise weightings allowed my program to make much more informed moves.
Implementing the described minimax tree was also a major improvement that formed the basis of my AI.
To prepare for the tournament, I made my program conditionally iterate (saving memory compared to just
recursing every move) to depth 5, but not further in the interest of time. I needed few additional functions.
I believe that these enhancements will make my AI a worthwhile competitor. I decided to pass on implementing
alpha-beta pruning since my AI executes well within time constraints and I found it a fairly cumbersome task.

Watching my AI progress far enough to crush "BetterPlayer" by a huge margin was extremely satisfying.
I can only hope that it fares well against the more formidable opponents in the tournament.
